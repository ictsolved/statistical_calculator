This was my first <strong>C Programming</strong> project to implement the statistical calculator when I was in the first semester.

It supports calculations for individual series.

<ol>
<li>Mean</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Variance</li>
<li>Standar Deviation</li>
</ol>

Please note that the programme works on TURBO C without any error.
